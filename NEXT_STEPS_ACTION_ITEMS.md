## ⚙️ Production Workflow Expansion (v2.1 → v2.2 pre-work)

### Done in current iteration
| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core tables & seed (`005_production_workflow.sql`) | ✅ |
| Progress view (`006_order_progress_view.sql`) | ✅ |
| SLA alerts endpoint `/api/production/alerts` | ✅ |
| Segment/workshop path endpoint `/api/production/path` | ✅ |
| JWT verification (`worker/auth.js`) | ✅ (read-only, generation pending) |
| Operator UI: segment path viewer | ✅ |
| Dashboard: overdue counter | ✅ |

### Required next steps
1. Apply migrations 005 & 006 to D1 (see commands below).
2. Populate `estimated_duration` for each stage (UPDATE statements).
3. Implement JWT issuance (`/api/auth/login`) returning `{ token }` (HS256, `exp` 24h).
4. Add anti-repeat scan guard (<3s between identical stage/order start).
5. Persist overdue events (optional table `production_alerts`).
6. Enhance dashboard: list of overdue transitions with elapsed minutes & responsible operator.
7. Extend `order_progress` to segment-specific total (filter `production_stages.segment IN (order.segment, NULL)`).
8. Add index: `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_stage_transitions_order_stage ON stage_transitions(order_id, stage_id, status);`
9. Add activity log for overdue acknowledgement.
10. Documentation updates (`docs/production-workflow.md`) with JWT/SLA sections.

### Suggested SQL adjustments
```sql
-- Set estimated durations (example values) – adjust to real data
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 15 WHERE id = 'st_001'; -- Распил
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 10 WHERE id = 'st_002'; -- Кромка
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 12 WHERE id = 'st_003'; -- Сверление
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 20 WHERE id = 'st_104'; -- Грунтовка
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 30 WHERE id = 'st_105'; -- Малярка
UPDATE production_stages SET estimated_duration = 18 WHERE id = 'st_106'; -- Полировка
```

### Wrangler migration commands
```bash
# Apply production workflow
wrangler d1 execute productlabelerpro --file migrations/005_production_workflow.sql

# Apply order progress view
wrangler d1 execute productlabelerpro --file migrations/006_order_progress_view.sql

# Verify views
wrangler d1 execute productlabelerpro --command "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='view';"

# Quick sanity check for progress
wrangler d1 execute productlabelerpro --command "SELECT order_id, progress_percentage FROM order_progress LIMIT 10;"

# Check overdue (after setting estimated_duration and starting some stages)
wrangler d1 execute productlabelerpro --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stage_transitions st JOIN production_stages ps ON ps.id=st.stage_id WHERE st.status='started' AND ps.estimated_duration IS NOT NULL;"
```

### JWT Generation (example pseudo)
```js
// Login handler idea
import { createHmac } from 'node:crypto';
function signHS256(payload, secret) {
  const enc = (obj) => Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(obj)).toString('base64url');
  const header = enc({ alg: 'HS256', typ: 'JWT' });
  const body = enc(payload);
  const data = `${header}.${body}`;
  const sig = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(data).digest('base64url');
  return `${data}.${sig}`;
}
// payload: { sub: userId, role, exp: Math.floor(Date.now()/1000)+86400 }
```

### Risk Notes
- Without estimated durations set, alerts return empty.
- JWT secret rotation requires invalidation strategy (add `iat` & `ver` claim).
- View `order_progress` counts all active stages globally; adjust for segment differentiation.

### Mini Roadmap (Production)
| Sprint | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Nov W2 | JWT issuance + segment progress refinement |
| Nov W3 | Overdue persistence + manager acknowledgement UI |
| Nov W4 | Performance indexes + caching `/api/production/stages` |
| Dec W1 | Predictive timing (ETA per order) |

---
**Next Immediate Action:** Apply migrations & update `estimated_duration` values.
